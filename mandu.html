    <h1>Mandu(Dumplings)</h1>
    <p>If there is Jiaozi in China and Gyoza in Japan, we have something similar called Mandu / Mandoo
        (만두) in Korea.
       There are many ways of making Korean mandu / Korean dumplings 
       and one of the most popular is Kimchi Mandu (Kimchi Dumplings, 
       김치만두). A bit too obvious? 🙂
        As you can gather, one of the main dumpling fillings 
        here is (napa cabbage) Kimchi. Typically, it’s also packed
         with minced pork and tofu as well. But these can be
         easily adapted to your preference </p>

    <p>HOW TO MAKE KIMCHI MANDU / KIMCHI DUMPLINGS

    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine and mix the filling ingredients in a mixing bowl. (I used my hand to mix.)</li>
        <li> Place a dumpling wrapper on your palm and add the filling in the centre of the wrapper. 
            Dip your finger in the water and lightly wet the edge of the dumpling wrapper.
            Seal the wrapper then place it on a non-stick flat surface.
            I’m still a newbie when it comes to folding dumplings, 
            so here is an awesome video instruction on “6 ways to fold 
            a dumpling“. Don’t get intimidated by it if yours don’t look
            pretty at first. It takes some practice to make them pretty. 🙂 )</li>

        <li>Cook mandu per your preference.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>STEAMED MANDU</h4>
    <p>Place some non-stick materials (e.g. cabbage leaves or baking paper) on a
         steamer and place the mandu in it. Make sure the mandu are not touching each other.
          Put the lid on. Place the steamer over rolling boiling water (in a sauce pan) and cook 
          the mandu for 15 to 20 minutes on medium low heat.</p>
    <h4>PAN FRIED MANDU</h4>
    <p>In a well heated pan, add some cooking oil. Place some mandu and cook over medium
         high heat until the bottom of the mandu is golden brown (2 to 3 mins). Reduce the heat
          to medium to medium low. Add the water (1/4 cup) and put the lid on to cook with the steam.
           This will ensure the meat is thoroughly cooked without burning. Your mandu should be ready
            to eat when most of the water disappears in the pan (in about 5 mins).</p>
